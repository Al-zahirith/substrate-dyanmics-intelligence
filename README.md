Genesis: Minimal Invariant Framework for Emergent Systems

A systems‑theory ontology for emergence, structure, intelligence, and multi‑scale dynamics.

Overview

Genesis is a minimal generative ontology describing how complex systems arise, stabilize, adapt, and collapse from a small set of invariants. It is domain‑agnostic and applies to physical, biological, cognitive, social, and artificial systems.

This repository contains the conceptual framework, scientific documentation, and formal definitions. It does not include implementations or applied systems.

Invariants

Genesis is representation‑agnostic. Geometric or symbolic forms (such as Φ, loops, or manifolds) are representational stabilizers, not ontological claims. Representations may influence system behavior but do not alter the underlying invariants.

Space

The domain in which distinguishable states can exist.

Time

The axis of change enabling ordering, history, and irreversibility.

Scale

Nested levels of structure that constrain and amplify one another.

Recursion

State self‑reference across time and scale.
A system is recursive only if prior state modulates future update rules.
Recursion is the mechanism by which systems become history‑bearing and capable of agency.

Φ

An irrational proportionality class that prevents recursive symmetry convergence.
φ is a canonical instance.
These ratios stabilize differentiation and prevent collapse into trivial symmetry.

Minimum topological requirement

Three distinguishable states are required to support closure, feedback, and gradient formation.
This is a topological constraint, not a geometric or numerological one.

Substrate Betterment Model

Every system shares a substrate. Nodes interact with that substrate through three roles:

Bᵢ — coherence contribution
Tᵢ — turbulence generation
Cᵢ — internal stability maintenance

Global system state:

S(t) = Σ Bᵢ(t) – Σ Tᵢ(t)

Universal states:

- Expansion: S(t) > 0
- Sustainment: S(t) = 0
- Collapse: S(t) < 0
- This model applies across domains and scales.

What this is not

- Not a consciousness claim
- Not a universal optimizer
- Not a value‑alignment framework
- Not a metaphysical doctrine
- Genesis is a generative, testable ontology for systems behavior.
