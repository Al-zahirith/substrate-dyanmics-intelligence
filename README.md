Genesis: Minimal Invariant Framework for Emergent Systems
A generative systems‑theory ontology for emergence, structure, intelligence, and multi‑scale dynamics.
DOI (doi.org in Bing)

Overview
Genesis is a minimal invariant ontology describing how complex systems arise, stabilize, differentiate, adapt, and collapse from a small set of structural invariants.
It is domain‑agnostic and applies across physical, biological, cognitive, social, and artificial systems.
This repository contains the conceptual framework, scientific documentation, and formal definitions.
It does not include implementations or applied systems.

Core Invariants
Genesis is representation‑agnostic. Geometric or symbolic forms (Φ, spirals, loops, manifolds) are stabilizers, not ontological claims.
Representations may influence system behavior but do not alter the underlying invariants.
Space
The domain in which distinguishable states can exist.
Time
The axis of change enabling ordering, history, and irreversibility.
Scale
Nested levels of structure that constrain and amplify one another.
Recursion
State self‑reference across time and scale.
A system is recursive only if prior state modulates future update rules.
Recursion is the mechanism by which systems become history‑bearing and capable of agency.
Φ (Irrational Proportionality Class)
An irrational proportionality class that prevents recursive symmetry convergence.
Φ (φ as a canonical instance) stabilizes differentiation and prevents collapse into trivial symmetry.

Minimum Topological Requirement
A system must contain three distinguishable states to support:
- closure
- feedback
- gradient formation
This is a topological constraint, not geometric or numerological.

Substrate Betterment Model
All systems share a substrate. Nodes interact with that substrate through three roles:
- Bᵢ — coherence contribution
- Tᵢ — turbulence generation
- Cᵢ — internal stability maintenance
Global system state:
S(t)=\sum B_i(t)-\sum T_i(t)
Universal states:
- Expansion: S(t) > 0
- Sustainment: S(t) = 0
- Collapse: S(t) < 0
This model applies across domains and scales.

What This Is Not
- Not a consciousness claim
- Not a universal optimizer
- Not a value‑alignment framework
- Not a metaphysical doctrine
Genesis is a generative, testable ontology for systemic behavior.
